# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022

It is an interesting experience. It looks like a different codding style: 
you need to get the **answer**. The code should solve only one specific problem 
only once. You **don't** have to worrying about performance, reliability and 
maintainance.

However, sometimes I wrote alternative solutions with more business/production
style code. But only because I was bored.

# Sum up

Some late tasks have to be optimized for performance because a raw brute force 
solution is very slow. Sometimes a slight improvement can reduce time from decades
to seconds. The best feeling ever.

I stent one day maximum to thing and solve daily tasks.

## About some days

 - Day 1. The only task I solved the next day. Because I just started the challenge on the 2d
December. 
 - Day 5. The first day I hardcoded a part of the input.
 - Day 6. The first alternative solution. I feel really bad when a code created a new `Set` 
on each iteration. Also, another solution caught my eye in the evening.. so, I implemented 
it in my code.
 - Day 7. The first task I was debugging a lot. Also, I did not write a proper solution 
for part 2.. so, I just printed an intermediate results and find the correct answer manually.
We only need to find the one answer, remember?
 - Day 8. The first day when part 1 code is almost useless to part 2. ????
 - Day 9. This day was a turning point. I was so mad on 10+ screens of description, I missed
several important details, and the first time I checked Reddit to find out what was wrong! 
And even after all spoilers, my code for second part did not work properly, whereas it worked
perfectly on test examples. It was the first day I wrote a visualization to debug. I almost 
gave up the Advent. The only day, I submitted the solution was not retrieved from my code.
I promise, I will come back to this task!
