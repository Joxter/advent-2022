# Advent of Code 2022

It is an interesting experience, it looks like a different codding style. 
When you need to write **one-time** code. This code should solve only one
specific problem only once. You **don't** have to worrying about performance or 
reliability or maintainance.

However, I wrote sometimes alternative more bussiness/production style code. 
But only because I was bored
